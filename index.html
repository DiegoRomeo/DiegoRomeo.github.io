              High school student at Liceo Scientifico M. Malpighi in Rome.
              In my free time I practice calisthenics.
              When I'm not training I usually go out with friends or drink some coffee while coding (btw I use Arch xd).

              Astro-Pi Mission Space Lab, organized by the European Space Agency (ESA) in collaboration with the Raspberry Pi Foundation offers teams of young people the chance to have their scientific experiments run on board the International Space Station.
              This year I'm partecipating with 2 friends of mine as the PizzaDev team.
              Our goal is to find places affected by desertification determine whether the desertification process is caused by an overexploitaion of natural resources due to nearby settlements.

              Romecup 2022 is a science faire based in Rome.
              The event took place in the Marco Polo building at Sapienza Università di Roma.
              There dozens of robots and their makers had their own stand to show their projects.
              I took part at the event by making a robotic arm, for which I implemented forward kinematics, inverse kinematics, voice control and an AI algorithm to make the robot dance any given song!

              Maker Faire Rome is the biggest edition worldwide of Maker Faire, a science faire for makers of any age.
              I had an amazing time being an exhibitor at the IX edition (2021). Hundreds of innovative projects... It was like a playground for a child!
              For this science faire I made 11 classical physics simulators in Python, to support teaching in the pandemic era:
              the idea of building the simulators came from the fact that in our school we were not able to use our labs to make scientific experiments, due to COVID-19.
              So I decided to make this set of simulators that are accessible through an UI interface (which was also designed by me using Adobe Illustrator).
              The user can also read through the Python App the theory behind each simulator.
